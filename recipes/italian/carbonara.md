# carbonara

My favorite carbonara, simple and rich.

## ingredients

#### ingredients
- 2 eggs, plus 5 egg yolks
- 1 oz grated parmigiana reggiano
- 2 oz grated pecorino romano
- 1 tbsp freshly ground black pepper
- 1 box (12 oz) buccatini or spaghetti
- 1 package pancetta
- 2 shallots, minced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp aleppo pepper
- 1/4 cup white wine
- italian parsley

## directions
- Freeze the pork shoulder for a few hours until firm, then slice as thin as
  possible, trimming away as much excess fat / connective tissue as possible.
- Mix all the marinade ingredients together, then combine with pork and onions
  in a bowl.
- Marinate at least 24 hours in the refigerator.
- Freeze portions in ziploc / vacuum seal bags.

## directions
- Combine eggs, yolks, cheese, and pepper in a mixing bowl.
- Bring a pot of water to a boil.
- In a medium pan, add 1 tbsp olive oil and pancetta, then turn heat to medium
  low, cooking until the fat is rendered and the pancetta is crisp.
- Add the shallots and some salt, cooking until translucent (about 1
  minute).
- Add the garlic and aleppo pepper, cooking for 30s.
- Add the white wine, and cook for 1 min, reducing slightly
- Meanwhile, the water should be boiling. Add a **ton** of salt to the boiling
  water, and add the pasta. Cook the pasta until a minute before al dente.
- Reserve 3-4 cups of the pasta water, and drain the pasta, keeping some extra water
  in the pot. Return the pot with water back to the stove, turning heat to low.
- In a large metal bowl, add the contents of the pancetta pan to the drained
  pasta. Put over the now simmering pot of water, and add the egg/cheese
  mixture, stirring constantly until absorbed.
- Add pasta water, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly until absorbed. You
  can add a **shocking** amount of pasta water in this way (usually around 2
  cups), and this will give the dish it's final creaminess.
- When all pasta water has been absorbed and the pasta is at the desired
  creaminess, add chopped parsley.
- Serve in a warm bowl.
