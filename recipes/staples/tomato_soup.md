# tomato soup

This simple weeknight staple is hearty yet healthy, quick to cook up, and pairs
wonderfully with anything from toasted sourdough to grilled cheese.

## ingredients

- 1 can (28 oz) San Marzano tomatoes
- 1 cup broth (chicken or vegetable works nice)
- 1 yellow onion, diced
- 1 carrot, diced (optional, but nice)
- 3 tbsp butter
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 tsp aleppo pepper
- 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
- salt and pepper to taste

## directions
- In a medium saucepan, melt butter over medium heat and cook onions and
  carrots, with a 1/2 tsp or so of salt, until soft.
- Meanwhile, using an immersion blender, puree the tomatoes in the can.
  Alternately, you can do this by hand in a large bowl.
- Once onions are cooked, add tomato paste and cook for 1 min or so.
- Add garlic, aleppo pepper, and smoked paprika, cooking for another minute or
  so.
- Add pureed tomatoes and broth, and bring to a simmer.
- Simmer for at least 45 minutes.
- Season with salt and pepper (sometimes adding a bit of sugar if too tart).
- Puree smooth with an immersion blender.
- Serve in a warm bowl.
