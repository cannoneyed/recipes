# one pot orecchiete

## ingredients

- 3 links sweet italian sausage, crumbled
- 1 bunch broccoli rabe (leaves stripped and shredded)
- 1 yellow onion, diced
- 1 box (16 oz) orecchiette
- 3 cups chicken broth
- 8 cloves garlic
- 1/2 tsp fennel seed
- 1 tsp aleppo pepper flakes
- parmigiano reggiano

## directions
- In a dutch oven, add 1 tbsp olive oil and cook crumbled sausage over medium
  heat until deeply browned. The browner the sausage, and thicker the fond, the
  better the dish will turn out.
- Add the onion and some salt, cooking until the onion is translucent (about 5
  minutes).
- Add the garlic, fennel, and chile, cooking from 30s to a minute (avoid burning
  the garlic).
- Add the box of orrecchiette, then cover with broth.
- Bring to a simmer, then cook until most of the liquid has been absorbed and the
  pasta is cooked. The pasta should be in a thick, starchy gravy.
- Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
- Serve in a warm bowl, covering generously with parmigiano reggiano.
