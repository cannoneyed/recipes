# clam linguine

## ingredients

- 2 cans chopped clams (separate clams from juice)
- 2 tbsp finely diced salami
- 4 shallots, minced
- 6 cloves garlic
- 1/2 cup white wine
- 1 box (12 oz) linguine
- 1 package arugula (chopped)
- 1/2 bunch italian parsely (chopped)
- 1 tsp aleppo pepper flakes
- parmigiano reggiano

## directions
- Bring a pot of water to a boil.
- In a dutch oven, add 1 tbsp olive oil and cook salami over medium
  heat until deeply browned. The browner the salami, the
  better the dish will turn out.
- Add the shallots and some salt, cooking until translucent (about 2
  minutes).
- Add the garlic and chile, cooking for 30s.
- Add the clam juice and white wine, and 1/3 of the parsley.
- Meanwhile, the water should be boiling. Add a **ton** of salt to the boiling
  water, and add the pasta. Cook the pasta until a minute before al dente.
- Reduce the sauce by 2/3, then add the drained pasta, chopped arugula, and 1/3 of the parsely.
- Finish cooking the pasta in the sauce for an additional 2-3 min, or until all
  of the liquid has been absorbed.
- Add the remaining 1/3 of the parsely, and grate in a fair amount of parmigiano
regiano.
- Serve in a warm bowl, covering generously with parmigiano reggiano.
