# chorizo cassoulet
A rich and hearty spanish-style sausage and bean cassoulet, perfect for cold
weeknights at home or dinners with friends.

#### ingredients
- 1 naturally cured spanish chorizo
- 2 butifarra sausages
- 1 yellow onion, diced
- 1 red bell pepper, diced
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 tbsp fish sauce (optional but highly recommended)
- 2 tbsp sweet paprika
- 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp freshly ground black pepper
- 1 tbsp aleppo pepper
- 4 tbsp chopped Italian parsley
- 1 20oz jar cooked Fabada beans (I prefer Luengo brand)
- 1 28oz can San Marzano tomatoes
- 1/2 to 1 cup chicken stock (more or less depending on how soupy you'd like)

## directions
- Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
- Cut the sausages into small half circles.
- In a wide braiser / skillet, lightly brown the sausage over medium heat in 2 tbsp olive oil.
- When the sausage is browned, remove to a bowl.
- Add onion and pepper, and 1 tsp salt. Cook until soft, about 4 minutes.
- While the vegetables are cooking, puree the tomatoes using an immersion
  blender or crush in a bowl with your hands.
- Add the tomato paste and cook for about 1 min or until it just begins to
  caramelize and stick to the bottom of the pan.
- Add the fish sauce and dry spices, cooking for about 1 min or until the liquid
  has evaporated.
- Add the garlic and cook for approximately 30 seconds.
- Add the jar of beans plus liquid, the crushed tomatoes, the chicken stock, and
  half of the parsley, stirring to combine all ingredients.
- Leave on the burner until it begins to simmer, then place in the oven.
- Bake for at least 30 minutes, or until the desired consistency is reached. The
  dish is great both soupy or thick.
- Remove from the oven and stir in the remaining parsley. Serve in a warm bowl
  with crusty bread and butter.
