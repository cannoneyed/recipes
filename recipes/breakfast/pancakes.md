# Pancakes

My favorite pancake recipe, a staple for lazy sunday breakfasts. Excellent with any additions you happen
to have on hand, such as yogurt, buttermilk, blueberries. Serve on a warm plate with maple syrup or
creme fraiche & jam.

## ingredients (serves 2 hungry adults)

- 1 cup (128 g) flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1/8 tsp baking soda
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 1 large egg
- 3/4 cup milk
- Juice of 1/2 lemon

## directions

- In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
- In a separate bowl, whisk together egg, milk, sugar, and lemon juice.
- Combine the dry ingredients with the wet ingredients, mixing lightly into a shaggy batter.
- Meanwhile, heat a skillet to medium-low. Add 1 tbsp butter, and add the pancake batter to the pan.
  I usually do 3 at a time.
- Cook until light bubbles form in the pancake, then flip (ensuring the bottom is crisp and golden).
- Serve!
