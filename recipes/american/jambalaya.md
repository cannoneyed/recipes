# Jambalaya

Surprisingly simple and easy for such a punchy and impressive meal, this Jambalaya recipe is as great for groups as it
is comforting. Feel free to improvise with the ingredients.

## ingredients

- 3 andouille sausages, chopped bite-size (or other smoked sausage, chorizo is great as well)
- 1 lb (~4) chicken thighs, chopped bite-size
- 3/4 lb shrimp
- 1 red bell pepper, diced
- 1 green bell pepper, diced
- 1 large yellow onion, diced
- 1 bunch green onions, diced
- 3 stalks celery, diced
- 1 28oz can tomatoes, crushed
- 3 cups chicken broth
- 2 cups rice (Jasmine works great)
- 1 can clams
- 2 tbsp Old Bay seasoning
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp paprika
- 2 tbsp fish sauce
- 2 anchovies
- 1 cup white wine
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 bunch green onions, finely diced
- 1 bunch tarragon, leaves pulled and shredded

## directions
- In a large pot, saute the sausage in 3 tbsp olive oil over medium heat until nicely browned. Remove the sausage with a slotted spoon to a bowl
- Add the chicken to the oil and fry until browned. Remove the chicken with a
  slotted spoon to the sausage bowl.
- Add the diced vegetables (peppers, onions, 1 bunch green onion, and celery) and a tablespoon of salt, and saute until vegetables
  are soft, about 10 minutes.
- When the vegetables are soft, add the old bay, paprika, garlic, and anchovies,
  and cook stirring for 1-2 minutes.
- Deglaze with the white wine and fish sauce.
- When the liquids have evaporated, add the rice and stir quickly into the hot
  mixture.
- Add the tomatoes, chicken broth, juice from the can of clams, and bay leaf, stirring to combine
  everything.
- Bring to a simmer and cover, reducing heat to low.
- Cook for 30-40 minutes or until the liquid has been absorbed, stirring
  occasionally to avoid sticking to the bottom and adding chicken
  broth if the mixture appears too dry. The recipe is lovely with either firm,
  just-cooked rice grains, or almost-disintegrated rice grains - it's up to you
  how long to cook and allow the grain to break.
- 5-10 minutes before serving, add the shrimp and clams and stir, keeping
  covered over low heat. Cook until the shrimp are opaque.
- Stir in 3/4 of the finely diced green onions and tarragon.
- Plate in a wam bowl, and top with green onions.
