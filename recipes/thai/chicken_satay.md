# chicken satay
## ingredients

#### Marinade
- 1/4 cup lemongrass, minced
- 2 shallots, minced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 to 2 fresh thai chiles
- 1 thumb-size piece galangal or ginger
- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric
- 2 tablespoons coriander
- 2 teaspoons cumin
- 3 tablespoons dark soy sauce
- 3 tablespoons fish sauce
- 6 tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil

#### meat
- 8 boneless chicken thighs

## directions
- Make the marinade by placing the lemongrass, shallots, garlic, chiles,
  galangal or ginger, turmeric, coriander, cumin, soy sauce, fish sauce, brown
  sugar, and oil in a food processor or chopper. Process well.
- Taste-test the marinade. You should taste sweet, spicy, and salty. In order for the satay to taste its best, the strongest flavors should be sweet and salty. Add more sugar or more fish sauce (in place of salt) to adjust the taste. You also can add more chile if you want it spicier.
- Cut chicken into small pieces or stripsâ€”thinner is better.
- Place in a bowl and pour the marinade over. Stir well to combine. Allow at
  least 2 hours for marinating, or longer (up to 24 hours).
- When ready to cook, thread meat onto the skewers. Fill up to 3/4 of the
  skewer, leaving the lower half empty so that the person grilling has a
  "handle" to easily turn the satay.
- Grill the satay, basting the first time you turn it with a little of the
  leftover marinade from the bowl. Depending on how thin your meat is, the satay
  should be done in 10 to 20 minutes.
