## instructions
- Fry all the "dry" spices in a wok with no oil, on medium heat, for 2-3 minutes
  until fragrant. Add the smallest spices last so they won't burn.
- Pound the roasted spices in a mortar / pestle until finely ground. Add the
  rest of the ingredients a little at a time in sequence, pounding and scraping
  the sides until the mixture forms into a smooth paste. This will take some
  time, but is infinitely better than using a blender/food processor.
- Curry pastes can be frozen in ice cube trays or small tupperwares for later
  use, lasting about 6 months.
