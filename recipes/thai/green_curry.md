# green curry (chicken)

## ingredients

#### curry paste
- 1 green chili (sliced)
- 1/4 cup shallot
- 4 garlic cloves
- 1 thumb-size piece ginger (grated)
- 1 stalk fresh lemongrass (minced)
- 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon shrimp paste
- 1 cup fresh coriander
- 1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper
- 2 1/2 teaspoons fish sauce
- 1 teaspoon brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lime juice
- 1/4 can coconut milk

#### for the curry
- 4 kaffir lime leaves
- 2 teaspoons peanut oil
- 3/4 can coconut milk
- 1 1/2 pounds boneless chicken thigh (or breast, cut into chunks)
- 1 red or green bell pepper (seeded and cut into chunks)
- 1 handful green beans (or 1 small zucchini or other vegetables of your choice)
- 1 generous handful of fresh thai basil

## directions
- To make the curry paste, place all of the paste ingredients in a food
  processor and process until a smooth consistency. Set aside.
- Prepare the kaffir lime leaves by tearing the leaf away from either side of the stem. Discard central stem. Using scissors, cut the leaves into thin strips. Set aside.
- Warm a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add oil and swirl around, and add the green curry paste. Stir-fry briefly to release the fragrance, 30 seconds to 1 minute.
- Reserve 1 tablespoon per serving of coconut milk to use later, and add the remaining coconut milk to the wok.
- Add chicken, stirring to incorporate. When the curry sauce comes to a boil, reduce heat to medium or medium-low and simmer 5 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through. Stir occasionally.
- Add the vegetables, plus strips of a lime leaf (or lime zest), stirring well to incorporate. Simmer until vegetables are cooked to your liking. Do a taste-test.
- Serve with Thai jasmine rice on the side, allowing guests to add their own. Top each portion with fresh basil, then drizzle 1 tablespoon of reserved coconut milk over each.
