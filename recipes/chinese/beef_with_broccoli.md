## directions
- Slice the flank steak (taking care to cut **against** the grain)
- Mix the marinade ingredients, and marinate the sliced beef from 30 minutes to
  an hour.
- Whisk together the sauce ingredients while the beef is marinating
- Meanwhile, roast the broccoli florets in a 400Â° oven for 20 minutes or until
  lightly charred.
- Heat up the oil in a large wok or skillet over medium high heat, then fry the
  beef in batches (don't crowd the pan).
- After cooking the beef, add the sesame oil, garlic, and ginger to the
  remaining oil in the pan and cook for ~30s.
- Add the beef back to the pan, along with any accumulated juices and the sauce.
- Add the cornstarch mixture, sliced green onions, and (optional) kale. Cook for
  2-3 minutes or until thickened.
- Add the roasted broccoli, and serve with rice (brown is excellent). Garnish with extra green onions.
