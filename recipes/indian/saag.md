# saag

Simple and easy saag, excellent with paneer, baked tofu, or pulled chicken.

## ingredients
(serves 4)

#### ingredients
- 1.5 lb fresh spinach (or 16 oz frozen spinach)
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 1 inch minced ginger
- 6 cloves minced garlic
- 1 large serrano chile, finely minced
- 1/2 tsp garam masala
- 2 tsp ground coriander
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1/2 tsp turmeric
- 1/4 tsp heeng
- 1.5 cups chicken stock
- salt
- 3 tbsp ghee / canola oil
- 2 tbsp butter
- 1/2 cup yogurt

## directions
- Wilt the spinach in a large pot, with a little vegetable oil.
- After the spinach is wilted, puree in a food processor.
- In a large braiser / dutch oven, cook the diced onions (in ghee or canola oil,
  with a tbsp of salt) until a rich golden brown / toffee color. I usually cook
  on low/medium-low to avoid burning. This is the foundation of the
  dish and will take 25-30 min.
- Meanwhile, mince the garlic / ginger and pound into a paste with a mortar and pestle.
- When the onions are translucent, add the minced pepper and heeng.
- When the onions are browned, add the ginger / garlic paste and cook for 2
  minutes.
- Add the spice mixture and cook for an additional 2 minutes.
- Add the chicken stock and pureed spinach, and stir the mixture completely,
  bring to a simmer, then cook covered for 5 minutes.
- Set heat to low, then slowly stir in butter and yogurt until completely
  incorporated.
- Add the paneer, tofu, or chicken and heat through.
- Serve with basmati rice, naan, or a crusty bread in a warm bowl.
