# refried black beans
## ingredients

#### ingredients
- 2 28oz cans black beans
- 1 1/2 white onions, diced
- 1 ts salt
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
- 1/2 bay leaf
- 4 tbsp bacon fat or butter

## directions
- To a medium saucepan, add 4 tbsp cooking fat over medium heat.
- Add onions and salt, cooking until soft and translucent, approximately 5 min.
- Add garlic, smoked paprika, and bay leaf, cooking for 30s.
- Add the beans and liquid, and bring to a simmer.
- Cook 2-3 hours at a gentle simmer.
- When beans begin to soften, smash against the side of the saucepan with a
  wooden spoon. The beans will gradually break apart. I usually smash until the
  beans are about 25% solid.
- Season with salt & freshly ground black pepper.
