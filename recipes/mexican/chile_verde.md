# chile verde

## ingredients
- 3 lb trimmed pork shoulder, cubed
- 5 poblano peppers
- 8 anaheim peppers
- 2 lb tomatillos, husks removed
- 6 garlic cloves
- 2 jalapeno peppers, seeds removed
- 3 tbsp vegetable oil
- 2 cups cilantro, loosely packed
- 1 large onion, diced
- 1 tbsp ground cumin
- 1/2 tbsp ground coriander
- 1 tsp aleppo pepper
- 1 quart chicken stock
- 1 lb small yukon gold potatoes, cut in half

## directions
- In a large bowl, toss the cubed pork with 2tbps kosher salt until thoroughly
  coated and let sit for 1 hr.
- Cut the poblanos, anaheims, and jalapenos in half and remove the seeds.
- Place the peppers skin side up on a baking sheet, and place in a 400 degree
  oven until the skins are charred, about 10 minutes. Remove and place in a large bowl or other
  container with lid, and let steam for 5 minutes. I usually do this in two batches.
- After the peppers have steamed, peel off the charred skins and place into a
  food processor, along with the garlic and cilantro.
- After peeling and rinsing the tomatillos, cut in half and place on a baking
  sheet. Bake in the oven until blistered and softened, about 8 minutes. Remove
  from bakign tray into the food processor.
- Once tomatillos, peppers, and cilantro had been added to the food processor,
  pulse on and off until roughly pureed but not smooth.
- In a dutch oven or large stockpot over medium-high heat, add the vegetable oil
  and brown the pork in batches (don't crowd the pan to ensure a nice browning).
  After browning the pork, set aside.
- Once the pork has been browned, add the diced onion to the pot and cook until
  softened and translucent, about 7 minutes.
- Add the cumin, coriander, and aleppo pepper to the onions, and cook for 1
  minute.
- Add the pork, pureed pepper/tomatillo mixture, and stock. Bring to a simmer,
  then cook until the pork is almost fork-tender (about 2 1/2 hours)
- Add the potatoes, and cook until they can be pierced easily with a fork (about
  30 minutes)
- Season with salt and black pepper, and add any additional chopped cilantro.
- Flavor will improve if left overnight in the fridge, and can be frozen.
- Serve with rice, tortillas, or with bread.
