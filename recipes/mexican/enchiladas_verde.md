# enchiladas verde

## ingredients
- 2 cups cooked chicken
- 1 pasilla pepper, diced
- 1 onion, diced
- 8 oz mushrooms, diced
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 6 oz cheddar cheese, grated
- flour tortillas (small ones)

#### sauce
- 3 tbsp butter
- 3 tbsp flour
- 1 1/2 cups milk
- 16 oz salsa verde (I use casa sanchez roasted salsa)

## directions
- In a skillet or pan, add 2 tbsp oil and bring to heat over a medium-high burner.
- Add mushrooms and cook until quite darkened (all of the moisture should be
  driven off).
- Add onion / pepper and a generous amount of salt, and cook until softened,
  around 5 minutes.
- Add the garlic, cooking for 30s.
- Add the chicken and 1/2 of the cheese, cooking until cheese is melted.

- Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, make a roux by melting butter and adding
  flour. Cook flour for ~30s to take off the raw edge.
- Add cold milk slowly, stirring to prevent lumps from forming to make a
  bechamel.
- Add the salsa verde and bring to simmer, then remove from heat.

- Lightly oil a baking dish, then fill tortillas with chicken mixture and place
  in rows in the dish.
- Cover the enchiladas with the milk/salsa mixture, then top with cheese.
- Bake for 30-40 minutes in a 400Â° oven, taking care not to burn the cheese (may
  have to add foil at first). Once cooked through and bubbling, broil the top to
  caramelize the cheese topping.
- Serve with refried black beans and cilantro lime rice.
